# KottCropper

A simple tool for cropping images to a specific aspect ratio, useful for cropping large number of images, for example if you are training a LORA.

Birme.net lacks the ability to crop only specific parts of an image, so I made this tool to do that.

I can bearly code so this is probably a mess, but it works.
